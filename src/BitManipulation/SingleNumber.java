/*
 * Question:
 * Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 *
 * Hint:
 * The key to solve this problem is bit manipulation.
 * XOR will return 1 only on two different bits.
 * So if two numbers are the same, XOR will return 0. Finally only one number left.
