/*
 * "A digital video recorder (DVR) is a device capable of recording TV programs
 * as requested by the user. The user can schedule several programs ahead of 
 * time to be recorded. A basic DVR will only let you record one channel at a
 * time, but advanced DVRs have two or more tuners, which allows you to record
 * several channels simultaneously. In this part, we will design and implement
 * a module to keep track of the scheduled programs.
 * The API of this module must contain a minimum of the following methods: 
 * - a method to schedule a program to be recorded, including the name of
 * the program, the start and stop time, and 
 * the channel - a method to specify how many tuners the DVR has
 * (the number of channels the DVR is able to record at the same time) 
 * - a method to query the scheduling conflicts 
 * (i.e. where more than the specified capacity of channels are scheduled 
 * to be recorded at the same time) Your code should include one or more 
 * simple tests to show how it is intended to be used. Please include the 
 * following test case, as well as any other test cases you deem necessary: 
 * On Tuesday 2011-05-17: Program "A" records from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM 
 * (on channel 3) Program "B" records from 9:10 PM to 11:30 PM (on channel 2)
 * Program "C" records from 10:50 PM to 11:50 PM (on channel 1) 
 * For this part, you are allowed to use any common external library, 
 * such as JUnit, Joda-Time, Apache Commons etc."
